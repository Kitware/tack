"""``contour`` of a structured grid by flying edges (issue #316), as VTK's
``vtkFlyingEdges3D`` and Viskores' flying edges: crossings found on the grid's
edges, counted along each row of points, numbered by a scan and written once,
so triangles share their points with no per-corner arrays and no sort.

Its triangles, points and the values carried are the general path's
(``contour._contour_points`` and its merge), up to the order of points and
triangles: every crossing is read through the same views (an image's and a
rectilinear grid's positions by ``get_ijk``, as its cells read them), placed
from the end first by position, and named by its end where it lands on one
(``_end_hit``); every cell takes the same triangles of the hexahedron's case
table; a triangle two of whose points are one point is dropped.

Each point owns the crossings of its edges along +x, +y and +z, and the point
itself where a crossing lands on it; per value, its edges' codes (none, between
the ends, at this end, at the far end; two bits an edge) are found once, then
each row of points counts what it emits and each row of cells its triangles,
in the order (row, value, along x). The triangles' pass walks each row of
cells along x with a running count for each of the four rows of points around
it, as VTK's does, so a crossing's number is found without a table a point.

Each (row, value) has a window of points, ``[lo, hi]``, outside which none of
its points' edges is crossed, and only the windows' flags are kept (at
``offset + i - lo``): a contour's are whole rows; a plane's (``cut``, as
``vtkFlyingEdgesPlaneCutter``) are found from the plane's equation, the
stretch of each row within the largest change of distance along an edge of the
plane, so a slice visits only the cells near it, its values computed where
they are read rather than stored for every point; a curvilinear grid's planes
take whole rows, the values still computed where read.

Hidden and refined cells (``Ghosts.MASKED_CELLS``, an AMR box's) make no
triangles, and crossings only they use are dropped afterwards, as for cells
with a NaN corner: the general path's output, which extracts the other cells
first, without the extraction.
