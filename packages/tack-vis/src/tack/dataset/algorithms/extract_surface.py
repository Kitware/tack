"""``extract_surface``: the faces of set ``name`` as a surface dataset: triangles and quads on the points they use, each in its side 0's outward order. Fields on faces become the surface's cell fields, and so do cell fields (``Constant``, values on cells), each face taking its side 0 cell's value; point fields (``H1``, values on points) come with the points, and ``L2`` fields as each face's trace. A solid's order-2 field or geometry stays order 2 on its surface, gathered by entity: the faces' points, edges and quad centers are the surface's. The geometry must be ``H1``: an ``L2`` one has no shared points for the faces to stand on."""

    does every ``L2`` field on polyhedra. The geometry must be ``H1``: an
    ``L2`` one has no shared points for the faces to stand on.

    Given a ``PartitionedDataSet``, the whole's surface, a piece each: each
    piece's boundary, less the faces two pieces share. Pieces without ghost
    cells take the faces between them for boundary; the faces of every piece's
    surface are matched over the pieces by their points (by position, as
    ``generate_global_ids`` matches them), and a face held unmarked by two
    pieces is between them and dropped. On pieces with ghost cells no such face
    is on a boundary, and each piece's surface is its own, its ghost faces
    marked. The surface's points are owned once (``generate_global_ids`` marks
